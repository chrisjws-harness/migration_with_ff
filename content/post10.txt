Publish an Allure Report to the Artifacts tab
This tutorial provides an example pipeline that builds a Java Maven application and generates an Allure Report that you can view in the Harness UI.

NOTE
Artifact tab publishing is supported in the Kubernetes infrastructure only.

Pipeline workflow
This pipeline has five steps that do the following:

Runs the Maven tests present in the project.

Generates the Allure Report using the allure-results generated as part of step 1. The Allure tool is present in the solutis/allure:2.9.0 Docker image used as part of the step.

Combines the Allure Report into a single HTML file.

Viewing an Allure Report in a browser requires running a web server via the allure open command. But this won't allow viewing the report after the CI pipeline is complete.

Use the allure-combine tool to convert the Allure Report into a single HTML file. Running allure-combine . inside allure-report generates the complete.html file. This step uses the shubham149/allure-combine:latest Docker image with the allure-combine tool present in it.

Publishes the report to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

Uses static web hosting in GCS to display the Allure Report on the Artifacts tab.

The plugins/artifact-metadata-publisher plugin adds the input URLs to the Artifacts tab in the Harness UI.
