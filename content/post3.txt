Deploy a Helm Chart using Harness GitOps for Argo CD
GitOps extends practices of Source Code Management into infrastructure and deployment of applications. Argo CD is the most popular project in this space. Even if you are new to GitOps and/or Argo CD, you have nothing to worry since Harness makes it really easy to get started. First you will need to sign up for a Harness Account. Harness works on a concept of Projects. The default project created when signing up for Harness is fine for the example.
