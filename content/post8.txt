Run LocalStack as a Background Step
Background steps are useful for running services that need to run for the entire lifetime of a Build stage. This tutorial shows how to run LocalStack as a Background step in a Harness CI pipeline. LocalStack is software that emulates cloud services (such as AWS) when developing locally, or for testing in continuous integration pipelines.

TIP
If you don't have a Harness account yet, you can create one for free at app.harness.io

Create Your Pipeline
Create a new pipeline in Harness CI.
Click Add Stage and select Build. Give your stage a name, optionally configure the repository to be cloned, then click Set Up Stage.
Select "Cloud" in the Infrastructure tab.
Add Background Step
This will run the LocalStack Docker image as a Background step in your pipeline.

In the Execution tab of your pipeline stage, click Add Step. The Step Library dialogue window should appear, select the Background step.
Enter "localstack" in the Name field.
Expand the Additional Configuration section, click the Container Registry field and either select an existing Docker Hub connector, or create one.
Enter the desired LocalStack Docker image in the Image field (for example, localstack/localstack:1.2.0).
If you have a LocalStack API key, add a LOCALSTACK_API_KEY environment variable in the Environment Variables section.
Click Apply Changes.
Add Step
This will add a step to ensure the LocalStack service is healthy. The step will run the curl command to poll the LocalStack service's /health endpoint until it returns successfully. This ensures that LocalStack is ready to receive traffic before the pipeline continues.

In the Execution tab of your pipeline stage, click Add Step then select Run.
Enter "localstack health" in the Name field.
Enter the following command in the Command field.
until curl --fail --silent --max-time 1 http://localstack:4566/health; do sleep 2; done


Expand the Optional Configuration section, click the Container Registry field and select your Docker Hub connector.
Enter curlimages/curl:7.83.1 in the Images field.
Click Apply Changes.
